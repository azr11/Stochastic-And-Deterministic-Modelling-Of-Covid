# Stochastic-And-Deterministic-Modelling-Of-Covid
So I have put together all of my code from my poster into this one little repository. Hope you all enjoy!
I have the following files here:
1) The network model (courtesy of Szilvia)
2) The differential equations model
You are more than welcome to make your own little dictionaries and create your own mini outbreak. You can create your own animations (although that will take a long time to compile). Only the dictionaries may be a little hard to understand, but other than that, I've left you all with the fun task of messing around with this.
